# Firebase Setup Guide for Eco-Guardian

## 🚀 Quick Start

The Firebase authentication error `auth/api-key-not-valid` means your `.env.local` file contains placeholder credentials instead of real Firebase project credentials. Follow this guide to get real credentials.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Visit Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account (create one if needed)

### Step 2: Create or Select a Project
- **If you have an existing project**: Click to select it
- **If creating new**: 
  1. Click "Create a project"
  2. Enter project name (e.g., "Eco-Guardian")
  3. Accept terms, click "Create project"
  4. Wait for setup to complete (~1 minute)

### Step 3: Set Up Web App
1. In the Firebase Console, click the **Settings icon** ⚙️ (top left)
2. Select **Project Settings**
3. Find the "Your apps" section or click the **Web icon** `</>`
4. Click "Register app" if this is your first web app
5. Enter app name (e.g., "Eco-Guardian Web")
6. Check "Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app" (optional)
7. Click "Register app"

### Step 4: Copy Firebase Configuration
After registering, you'll see your Firebase configuration. It looks like this:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyD...",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
  appId: "1:123456789012:web:abc123def456"
};
```

### Step 5: Update `.env.local`
1. Open the `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your real Firebase credentials:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyD...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789012
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789012:web:abc123def456
```

### Step 6: Enable Authentication Methods
1. In Firebase Console, go to **Build** → **Authentication**
2. Click "Get started"
3. Click **Email/Password** provider
4. Toggle "Enable" and click "Save"
5. (Optional) Add Google, GitHub, or other providers

### Admin Accounts
Only users with the `admin` role can see the dashboard. By default every new signup is a regular user.
To promote an account:

1. Open the **Firestore Database** in the Firebase Console.
2. Navigate to the `users` collection and click the document matching the
   user's UID.
3. Edit the `role` field and change its value to `admin`.
4. Save the document.

Alternatively you can run the following client-side helper in the browser
console (after importing `db` from `src/firebase/firebaseConfig`):

```js
import { doc, updateDoc } from "firebase/firestore";

// replace UID with the user you want to promote
await updateDoc(doc(db, "users", "UID"), { role: "admin" });
```

After doing this, the next time that user logs in they will be able to access
`/admin/dashboard` (the admin panel).

The dashboard link appears in the navbar only for admins and requires an
admin account to reach.

### Step 7: Set Up Firestore Database (for data storage)
1. In Firebase Console, go to **Build** → **Firestore Database**
2. Click "Create database"
3. Start in **Test mode** (for development)
4. Click "Create"
5. Note: Remember to change to Production rules before deploying!

### Step 8: Set Up Firebase Storage (for file uploads)
1. In Firebase Console, go to **Build** → **Storage**
2. Click "Get started"
3. Start in **Test mode**
4. Click "Create"

### Step 9: Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it:
npm run dev
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Error: "auth/api-key-not-valid"
- **Cause**: `.env.local` has placeholder values
- **Fix**: Replace with real credentials from Firebase Console

### Error: "Firebase: Error (auth/configuration-not-found)"
- **Cause**: Firebase config not loaded properly
- **Fix**: Check `.env.local` is in project root, restart dev server

### Can't create account but no error message
- **Cause**: Authentication not enabled in Firebase
- **Fix**: Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Enable Email/Password

### Credentials look correct but still getting errors
- **Cause**: Dev server cached old environment variables
- **Fix**: 
  1. Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
  2. Delete node_modules/.vite folder (if exists)
  3. Restart dev server with `npm run dev`

## 🛡️ Security Notes

### Development (Current - Test Mode)
- ✅ Fine for development and testing
- ✅ Anyone can read/write data
- ⚠️ NOT secure for production

### Before Deploying to Production:
1. Change Firestore rules to production
2. Change Storage rules to production
3. Rotate API key (Firebase Console → Settings → API keys)
4. Set up environment-specific `.env` files
5. Never commit `.env.local` to git (use `.env.example` instead)
